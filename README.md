# Microbiome of Chinese Patients with Type 2 Diabetes

## Improvements
Some feedback I received included: Using a combinations of graphs and tables, reassessing my diagnostics for logistic regression, reducing wordiness in my interpretations. Personally, I could also improve the references as well.

## Drawback
I am passionate about the microbiomes of humans. However, passion is not enough. If I had more expertise in this domain, it would have made for a more robust project. I am proud of how much I learned in a quarter to put together this project, but I was limited in my understanding of the data as well. Here's to future research!
